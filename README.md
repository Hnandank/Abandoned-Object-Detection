# Abandoned-Object-Detection
Project on Abandoned Object Detection using Python.

This Python project focuses on detecting abandoned objects in public places using computer vision and deep learning. It involves developing a model that can analyze video feeds from CCTV cameras or other surveillance systems to identify objects left unattended for a certain duration. The project integrates OpenCV for video processing and TensorFlow or PyTorch for training a neural network model. Techniques like background subtraction, motion detection, and object tracking are employed to differentiate between stationary and moving objects. The goal is to improve security and prevent potential risks in crowded areas, such as airports, malls, or train stations.

This Python project focuses on detecting abandoned objects in public spaces by leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning technologies. The primary aim is to create a system that can analyze video footage from surveillance cameras, identify objects left unattended for a certain period, and issue alerts to prevent potential security threats. This project has practical applications in environments like airports, train stations, shopping malls, and other high-traffic areas where abandoned objects could pose risks.

To achieve this, the project employs OpenCV for handling video input and processing. The video stream is analyzed using techniques such as background subtraction, which helps in distinguishing between static and dynamic objects in the scene. Motion detection algorithms further assist in tracking object movement over time, allowing the system to recognize when an object has stopped moving and become stationary.

Once an object is identified as abandoned, deep learning models, are used to classify the object and determine whether it poses a potential risk. The neural network model is trained on a dataset containing various objects and scenarios, learning to recognize patterns in abandonment behavior.

The project also incorporates object tracking to continuously monitor the position of objects, and if an object remains in the same location without being attended to for a specified time, an alert is triggered. Additional features could include distinguishing between harmless objects like bags or umbrellas and more dangerous items to reduce false positives.

The system could be integrated with real-time monitoring tools or alert systems to notify security personnel in the event of suspicious activity. Overall, this project contributes to enhancing public safety by providing an automated, intelligent solution for abandoned object detection.
